## Learn Typescript

I'm using typescipt every day and often I have questions: How to do this? How to do that? Sometimes it's difficult to find answers for my questions and I spend a lot of time trying to solve some simple thing.

I read a lot of articles about typescript and sometimes I see interesting solutions which could be helpful.

My friends who using typescript sometimes share with me cheets and hacks they use in their projects.

I decided to accumulate all this knowledge in one place.
